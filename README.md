# Tortilla
CHIP-8 Interpreter

# Feb 2 - Feb 16

Starting development on CHIP-8. Had to start by making sure my project would build with cmake. Tested this by printing "test" to the console.

Once I ran the executable, "test" showed up, so things seem to be working.

## Accomplishments

- CMake files and build testing
